# JDBC_Personal_Project

## Purpose:

- My aim was to use the JDBC driver from Postgress to create an app that lets users write SQL scripts seamlessly, and provide options such as privileges and user loginn


## Program Features:

  * Make a database using Java code
  * Create SQL statements such as Create, insert, remove, and more, using Java
  * Take in User Input
  * Provide a menu option
  * Create privileges to allow users, such as admin and employee, different commands they can enact
  * Allow users to login 
  * Use Java features such as taking in user input, conditional statements, and loops to help provide a better user experience
